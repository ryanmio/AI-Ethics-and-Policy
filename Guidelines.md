# AI Policy Guidelines

The purpose of these guidelines is to assist organizations in effectively implementing and managing generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI). The document is structured into categories, each addressing a significant aspect of AI use.

Each topic within these categories is presented at three levels: **Good**, **Better**, and **Best**:

- `Good`: Represents a foundation level that covers essential practices.
- `Better`: Builds upon the good practices, offering a more optimized balance between resource allocation and advancement in AI practices.
- `Best`: Represents the ideal practices, which may require substantial resources but can potentially yield high returns.

It's worth noting that the "Best" level isn't necessarily a goal for every organization. Rather, it serves as a reference point for what is possible given unlimited resources. The "Better" level, on the other hand, is often a more realistic target for many organizations, given its balance of costs and benefits.

Organizations may refer to these guidelines in light of their specific context, resources, and strategic objectives. The goal is to incorporate AI in a responsible and efficient manner that aligns with your organization's mission and values.

## # Ethics and Risk Management
The ethical use of AI, especially Generative AI, requires organizations to ensure fairness, transparency, and respect for privacy. Additionally, the risks associated with AI usage, from inaccurate outputs to potential misuse, need to be carefully managed. Failing to do so can not only lead to operational issues but also damage an organization's reputation and legal standing.
